## Description

This repository contains the analysis code for the paper
titled "Vascular Aging causes Metastasis".
This repository includes analysis code for bulk
RNAseq analysis and single cell Analysis of Tabula Muris Senis
and LPS treated mice.

## Structure

Each folder holds the analysis to reproduce the analysis and figures.
Note some analysis require larger amounts of computational power and RAM to
be successfully executed.

## Usage
